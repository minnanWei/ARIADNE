{"name": "atcoder_arc190_c", "description": "Basic Grid Problem with Updates\n\nThere is an H \\times W grid. Let (h,w) denote the cell at the h-th row from the top and the w-th column from the left. A non-negative integer A_{h,w} is written in cell (h,w).\nTakahashi starts at cell (sh,sw) and will perform Q changes to the grid. The i-th change is given by a character d_i (d_i is one of L, R, U, D) and a non-negative integer a_i, meaning Takahashi will do the following:\n\n- Move one cell in the direction d_i. That is, if d_i is L, move left; if R, move right; if U, move up; if D, move down by one cell. Then, let the destination cell be (h,w), and set A_{h,w} to a_i.\n\nIt is guaranteed that in each change, he can move one cell in direction d_i.\nAfter each change, print the answer to the following problem:\n\nA sequence of cells P = ((h_1,w_1), \\ldots, (h_{M},w_{M})) is said to be a path if and only if it satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n- (h_1,w_1) = (1,1), (h_{M},w_{M}) = (H,W), and M = H + W - 1.\n- For every i with 1 \\leq i \\leq M-1, either (h_{i+1}, w_{i+1}) = (h_i + 1, w_i) or (h_{i+1}, w_{i+1}) = (h_i, w_i + 1).\n\nThere are \\binom{H+W-2}{H-1} paths. For a path P = ((h_1,w_1), \\ldots, (h_{M},w_{M})), define f(P) = \\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq M}A_{h_i,w_i}. Print the sum, modulo 998244353, of f(P) over all paths P.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH W\nA_{1,1} \\cdots A_{1,W}\n\\vdots\nA_{H,1} \\cdots A_{H,W}\nQ sh sw\nd_1 a_1\n\\vdots\nd_Q a_Q\n\nOutput\n\nPrint Q lines.\nThe i-th line should contain the sum, modulo 998244353, of f(P) over all paths P after performing the i-th change to the grid.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 2 \\leq H, W \\leq 200000\n- HW \\leq 200000\n- 0 \\leq A_{h,w} < 998244353\n- 1 \\leq Q \\leq 200000\n- 1 \\leq sh \\leq H, 1 \\leq sw \\leq W\n- 0 \\leq a_i < 998244353\n- H, W, A_{h,w}, Q, sh, sw, and a_i are integers.\n- Each d_i is L, R, U, or D.\n- In each change, Takahashi can move one cell in the direction d_i.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2 3\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n3 2 2\nU 7\nR 8\nL 9\n\nSample Output 1\n\n456\n666\n822\n\n\n- Initially, Takahashi is at (2,2).\n- Move up, then set A_{1,2} to 7. The value of f(P) for each path is:\n- P=((1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)): f(P)=1 \\times 7 \\times 3 \\times 6=126.\n- P=((1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)): f(P)=1 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 6=210.\n- P=((1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)): f(P)=1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6=120.\n\n\n- Move right, then set A_{1,3} to 8. The value of f(P) for each path is:\n- P=((1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)): f(P)=1 \\times 7 \\times 8 \\times 6=336.\n- P=((1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)): f(P)=1 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 6=210.\n- P=((1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)): f(P)=1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6=120.\n\n\n- Move left, then set A_{1,2} to 9.
